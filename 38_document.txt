MCP Applications
Level up to intelligent network control
Analytics. Automation. Agility.
Digital connectivity demands continue to increase rapidly. Networking technology is advancing at top speed to keep pace, and IP and optical architectures are converging. Now is the time to go beyond legacy Network Management Systems (NMS) and industry Software-Defined Networking (SDN) practices and take network operations to a new level with multi-layer intelligent network control, offered by Ciena’s Manage, Control and Plan (MCP) Applications.
With Ciena’s MCP domain controller as their foundation, MCP Applications provide analytics, software control, and automation to optimize multi-layer network performance and supercharge network operations to exceptional levels of efficiency and boost business agility.
MCP Applications benefits
Unified multi-layer view
Drive operational efficiencies through consistent and rapid planning, provisioning, and assurance of network services across multi-layer infrastructure with MCP Applications’ centralized, accurate view of the state of multi-vendor optical, Ethernet, and IP infrastructure.
Network performance optimization
Utilize Liquid Spectrum™, Adaptive IP™ Apps, and advanced analytics apps—all built on the MCP platform—to optimize multi-layer network performance from the photonic layer to the IP layer, and extract the most value from your infrastructure investment.
Automated network operations
Leverage MCP Applications’ open REST APIs and Ciena’s Emulation Cloud to integrate easily with Operational Support Systems (OSS), and streamline and automate end-to-end workflows, reducing OPEX.
