6500 Packet Transport System
Ciena’s 6500 Packet Transport System (PTS) addresses the growing need to maintain profitable delivery of TDM services while future-proofing investments toward an all-packet network modernization.
To this day, network providers continue to add to their Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) infrastructure—an investment that is getting more expensive to run and operate. Clearly doing more of the same only increases OPEX due to expensive spares and higher maintenance, hard-to-find legacy skill sets, and manual operations.
Features
Exceptional DS1, DS3, E1, E3, OC-3/12/48/192, STM-1/4/16/64, and 10/100/1GbE/10GbE, 40GbE/100GbE density to address space constraints
Preserves TDM service, no change to customer end or revenue, customer experience, and tariffs
Launches new Packet and CE services, including MEF CE 3.0-certified for E-Tree, E-Line, E-LAN, E-Access, and E-Transit
Features hardware-assisted packet OAM capabilities for guaranteed SLA differentiation
Offers Zero-Touch Provisioning (ZTP) for rapid, secure, and errorfree turn-up of packet services
Includes advanced packet synchronization and multi-layer protocol support
Integrates line-rate Service Activation Testing capabilities
Includes Ciena’s MCP multi-layer provisioning support for end-to-end network management control and planning
Offers flexible low-power configuration options with redundant power supply (DC) and fan modules
