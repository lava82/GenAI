Build
Delivering strong results
We do the hard work of building networks that help your business succeed. Ciena experts work with you—providing consulting, design, and planning services. We then complete your network installation, including third-party components.
Let us put you in front.
Everyone cheers the leader. But even the best need teammates working hard behind the scenes to win.
Operate
A baton passes between runners, one accelerating, one decelerating, within a scant 20 meters in a jumble of other teams. Miss one detail? Game over. Winning requires discipline, focus and experience.
Enabling worry-free operations
Our people rely on those same qualities, focusing on the details to deliver a global maintenance service and ITIL-based managed services―freeing your team to tackle strategic initiatives.
We do the worrying for you.
Improve
Delivering peak performance
Your network―and your team―exceed expectations by purposeful effort. Fine-tune your network infrastructure for peak performance with our network optimization services. And empower your staff to deeply understand and support your Ciena network with our networking classes and certifications.
We help you achieve more.
Behind the illusion of effortlessness is relentless effort to fine-tune countless movements.
Enabling how you manage, control, and plan your network
Bridge technical and resource gaps, increase your team’s agility, and deliver fast, efficient, data-driven operations. We help you fully leverage Ciena’s Manage, Control and Plan (MCP) domain controller and  Applications for a more rapid deployment and thorough adoption..
