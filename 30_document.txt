Packet-Optical Platform
Ciena’s 5410 Packet-Optical Platform is part of a family of multi-terabit packet-optical switching platforms that transform networks into scalable, flexible, cost-reduced, service-enabling infrastructures to meet today’s monumental traffic growth challenges.
Features
Offers a 5.0 Tb/s switch matrix with I/O modules supporting up to 500 Gb/s per slot
Allows users to select the most flexible networking model for packet, optical, and/or OTN redundancy options as needed
Provides more reliable, deterministic transport of packet services
Retains full mesh connectivity while most efficiently transporting Ethernet and other services over a DWDM optical network
Enables intelligent automated provisioning, planning, and protection/restoration via OneConnect, the world’s most advanced multi-layer ASON/GMPLS control plane
Consolidates SONET/SDH, OTN, and Ethernet/MPLS networks
