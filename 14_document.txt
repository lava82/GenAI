WaveLogic Encryption. Effortless.
Secure your in-flight data with WaveLogic Encryption. Always-on and where you need it.
WaveLogic™ Encryption
What do you get when you combine market-leading coherent optics with proven encryption technology on Ciena’s popular Waveserver® Ai platform? The industry’s first coherent 400G optical encryption solution.
WaveLogic Encryption is a simple-to-implement in-flight data protection solution with advanced security capabilities. This solution leverages the unmatched performance and programmability of Ciena’s WaveLogic Coherent Optics to efficiently meet all of your infrastructure needs. WaveLogic Encryption extends to Ciena’s flagship 6500 Family of Packet-Optical Platforms, enabling flexible 10G, 100G, and 200G wire-speed encryption solutions from a compact CPE appliance offering to a range of high-capacity applications.
Effortless encryption. Period.
Now it’s easy to evolve from cumbersome to commonplace encryption deployments. Ciena’s WaveLogic Encryption delivers an ultra-low latency, protocol-agnostic, wire-speed optical encryption solution to match today’s high-capacity infrastructure needs—from 10G to 100G, 200G, and beyond.
Deploy Ciena’s simple-to-implement WaveLogic Encryption for:
Maximum throughput with no impact to performance
Transparent transport of any protocol without additional hardware
Set-and-forget approach with always-on encryption
Seamless integration into existing enterprise Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs) using X.509 certificate-based authentication
Secure management by the end-user via a dedicated easy-to-use interface
Make hackers weep with ironclad optical encryption
In today’s web-scale communications, your in-flight data is secure as long as you can keep the hackers out. How robust is your optical encryption?
Ciena’s WaveLogic Encryption solution is purpose-built with the highest level of in-flight data security in mind to protect all of your information and lockout the bad actors:
Offers external third-party certification to ensure that it is implemented with industry-standard algorithms, including a FIPS-certified AES-256 encryption engine
Deploys two distinct, independent sets of keys for authentication and data encryption functions
Provides fast encryption key rotation interval down to the second (instead of minutes)
Leverages the highest security cryptography algorithms available today, including Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithms
Painless encryption management
WaveLogic Encryption is a complete solution that includes MyCryptoTool, a simple-to-use, dedicated encryption management end-user portal designed for distributed management of the network. This approach enables secure management of Encryption-as-a-Service capability by the end-user in carrier-managed or enterprise-managed networks.
MyCryptoTool ensures that only the owner of the data—the end-user—maintains full control of the encryption security parameters associated with their critical data. It’s easier than ever to issue new keys or certificates as required by your security policies—and you can monitor your encrypted services on an end-to-end basis with security-specific alarms and logs.
