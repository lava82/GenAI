Key components of the Ciena Virtualized Edge Solution
Advanced packet platforms
Leveraging our advanced packet platforms—3906 and 3926—along with Ciena D-NFVI software, the Ciena Virtualized Edge Solution delivers a highly scalable and reliable carrier-class infrastructure. It supports services up to 10 Gb/s, multiple options for in-field replaceable x86 servers, and multi-vendor VNF hosting capabilities. This solution is ideal for customers transitioning from a physical to a virtual network edge infrastructure.
Intelligent Automation Software
Blue Planet’s multi-vendor Virtual Edge Automation capabilities—leveraging Network Function Virtualization and Multi-Domain Service Orchestration (NFVO/MDSO), as well as Unified Assurance and Analytics (UAA)—enable customers to rapidly deliver high-value managed services like firewalls, routers, and other edge services. As part of the Ciena Virtualized Edge Solution, these capabilities reduce the order-to-service interval to minutes, increase service revenues by up to 20%, and reduce OPEX by up to 80%.
For service providers and enterprises seeking reliable, high-performance branch office connectivity, Blue Planet also offers an SD-WAN Automation solution. This solution is proven to speed service activation by up to 75% and decrease related OPEX by up to 90%.
The solution also includes Ciena’s microservice-based domain controlled Manage, Control, and Plan (MCP) to support and simplify multi-layer Ciena implementations.
Systems Integration Service
Complex network evolution requires highly specialized Systems Integration (SI) capabilities. Ciena’s SI Service provides deep expertise and experience, gained by enabling some of the world’s largest and most complex networks. We focus on service providers’ operational processes and network environments. Together with Ciena’s industry-leading hardware and software solutions, we’re the ideal systems integration partner for your network evolution.
