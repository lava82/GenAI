Packet-Optical Platform
Ciena’s 5430 Packet-Optical Platform is the industry’s first multi-terabit packet-optical switching platform that transforms networks into scalable, flexible, cost-reduced service-enabling infrastructures to meet today’s monumental traffic growth challenges.
Features
Utilizes Ciena's WaveLogicTM technology for coherent DWDM optical interfaces
Increases network availability for mission-critical services (measured in the field at over six-9s); and handles multiple simultaneous failures
Allows users to select the most flexible networking model for packet, optical, and/or OTN redundancy options as needed
Provides more reliable, deterministic transport of packet services
Retains full mesh connectivity while most efficiently transporting Ethernet and other services over a DWDM optical network
Provides 500 Gb/s per service slot capacity and offers a 15 Tb/s switch matrix
