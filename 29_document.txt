8180
Coherent Networking Platform
High-density packet aggregation. High-capacity coherent optical. You need both to elevate the experience for your end-users. We’ve got both—combined into one, compact modular platform—to simplify your network and reduce your packet and transport costs.
Ciena’s 8180 Coherent Networking Platform combines the industry-leading capacity and embedded intelligence of WaveLogic coherent transport with the density, openness, and programmability of a packet switch. As part of an end-to-end solution that peers with both packet switch devices and coherent networking platforms, it provides a high-density on-ramp to the coherent optical network.
8180 and Fiber Deep
Customers are demanding ever-faster Internet speeds and availability. In response, MSOs are trying to simplify operations by driving digital technologies closer to subscribers, with the goal of providing high-quality access to content.
As part of Ciena Fiber Deep Solutions, the 8180 delivers more bandwidth and scalability between hub and headend locations so network operators can reduce power and space. It also alleviates fiber congestion by providing an efficient mechanism to consolidate multiple 100 Gb/s connections from the access network into 400 Gb/s wavelengths for transport across the metro core.
Optical Transport category
