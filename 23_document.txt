Routing and Switching
Evolutionize your networks
Ultra High Definition (UHD) video streaming, the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR), and mobile gaming are just some of the omnipresent applications in our daily lives that change how we conduct business, interact, and simply have fun. Networks must evolve to support these applications—they must be able to adapt.
From our leading WaveLogicTM 5 Nano coherent pluggables to Adaptive IPTM, Ciena’s networking products and approaches allow operators to cost-effectively modernize their network assets by taking advantage of technologies like Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), Segment Routing, and edge computing—efficiently supporting existing business opportunities while preparing for new and emerging ones.
IP delivered differently
Ciena’s Adaptive IP is a unique approach that combines our market-leading routing and switching platforms with machine-learning-powered analytics and intelligent automation software to improve flexibility, scalability, and faster time-to-revenue—providing a more future-proof IP network architecture, from access to metro.
Our Routing and Switching platforms are…
Purpose-built for specific applications and use-cases
Avoid unnecessarily complex and costly overbuilds. Our cost-effective platforms are fully programmable, scalable, disaggregated, and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) ready, supporting open interfaces and streaming real-time telemetry. They have the right speeds, feeds, switching capacities, form-factors, environmental attributes, and power supply options to address your unique requirements, from access to metro. Whether it's 4G to 5G mobile network evolution, business services, cloud, Fiber Deep, broadband, or edge computing applications, we’ve got you covered.
Powered by Ciena’s Service-Aware Operating System
Ciena’s Service-Aware Operating System (SAOS) provides automation-friendly intelligence and streaming operational data to enable network-level programmability supported by open standards, such as IGP, BGP, Segment Routing, NETCONF/YANG, and gRPC.
Easy to manage—putting you in control of your unique mission-critical networks
Get unprecedented multilayer visibility with Ciena’s Manage, Control and Plan (MCP) software, which offers a unique and comprehensive network administration solution. MCP supports a programmable and automatable solution that leverages standards based NETCONF/YANG interfaces to provide fully open integration into any SDN environment.
Products
3000 Family
These cost-effective and compact platforms are available with a range of physical ports of up to 10GbE. They’re purpose-built to fit numerous small, medium, and large customer sites as well as multitenant office and residential buildings, supporting Passive Optical Networks (PONs), TDM, Ethernet, Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS), IP, Segment Routing, and virtual network services. Mounting options include rack, wall, pole or strand, with appropriate enclosures and temperature ranges to solve your unique challenges.

6500 Packet Transport System
Ciena’s 6500 Packet Transport System (6500 PTS) addresses the growing need to maintain the profitable delivery of legacy TDM services, while future-proofing investments toward network modernization. To this day, network providers continue to add to their TDM infrastructure—an investment that is getting more expensive to run and operate. Clearly doing more of the same only increases operational expenses due to expensive spares and higher maintenance, hard-to-find legacy skill sets, and manual operations.
8100 Family
As customers demand savings in power, cooling, and transport costs, Ciena’s family of coherent aggregation and metro routers are delivering results and changing the edge. With multiple coherent routers available, customers can choose the right mix of connections and services—from 1GbE to 400GbE and aggregation to 100/200/400GbE WaveLogic™ 5 Nano coherent pluggables.

WaveRouter
Ciena’s WaveRouter™ is a purpose-built coherent metro router designed to unify IP and Optical in the metro—with ultimate flexibility, future-proof extensibility, and improved network sustainability.
8700 Packetwave® Platform
Ciena’s 8700—a multi-terabit programmable Ethernet-over-DWDM packet switch—addresses the growing need to efficiently aggregate and switch large quantities of packet traffic while guaranteeing stringent Service Level Agreements (SLAs). It revolutionizes the capital and operational economics of 10GbE and 100GbE services in metro and regional Ethernet networks.
Pluggable Transceiver Family
Ciena’s family of pluggable transceivers allow for a flexible, pay-as-you-grow deployment model when adding specific functions to products within our Routing and Switching platforms. For example, WaveLogic 5 Nano 100G/200G/400G QSFP-DD and CFP2-DCO pluggable optics enable a highly flexible coherent transmission in a compact, pluggable form.

Traditional TDM services can be mapped onto a packet-based infrastructure, benefiting from its low cost-point while still maintaining the stringent timing and resilience required by the service. Shared fiber 10G PON Optical Line Terminals (OLTs) simply plug into a 3000/5000/8000 router or switch when and where you need it. The end result? New and renewed revenue streams.
