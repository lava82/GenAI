Liquid Spectrum
Optical reimagined for an on-demand world
Level up to a smarter optical network
Cloud. Virtual reality. Internet of Things. 5G. Your network transformation is underway. But it's being engineered, operated, and monetized in the same old static way. You need a smarter, faster way of keeping up with demands. But how?
Ciena's award-winning Liquid Spectrum™ combines real-time analytics and advanced automation across a programmable photonic layer to help you maximize the value of your network assets and realize the benefits of the Adaptive Network™. And now with Photonic Performance Gauge—which puts unprecedented visibility at your fingertips—you can optimize optical performance like never before.
It's optical, redefined for the on-demand world. It’s Liquid Spectrum.
Customer spotlight
See how our customers are using Liquid Spectrum to do a lot more with less—such as gaining more capacity with fewer modems, more visibility with less complexity, and more flexibility with less intervention in the network.

Delivering agility and scale through an instrumented, programmable optical layer
Liquid Spectrum leverages the rich instrumentation and in-service monitoring capabilities of WaveLogic™ Photonics, Ciena’s reconfigurable photonic layer that includes WaveLogic programmable coherent optics. The result? Actionable insights that enable providers to make intelligent decisions based on the current state of the network.
Key hardware elements
Flexible grid, reconfigurable photonic layer
Ciena's WaveLogic Photonics, a highly instrumented, flexible grid photonic layer, supports any combination of colorless, directionless, and contentionlessflexibility.
Variable bit-rate, programmable coherent optics
Ciena's WaveLogic coherent optics deliver 100G to 800G solutions, with tunable capacity in 50G increments, enabling operators to maximize capacity across all paths in their network.
Efficient matching of clients to variable line capacity
A centralized Optical Transport Network (OTN) or packet switching architecture, such as Ciena’s 6500 Packet-Optical Platform, or a high-density muxponder solution, like Waveserver® Ai or Waveserver 5.
Redefining optical with advanced software applications
Liquid Spectrum’s advanced software applications leverage Ciena's Manage, Control and Plan SDN domain controller and open APIs to abstract complexity associated with advanced flexible technologies, enabling operators to fully operationalize and realize the benefits associated with a modernized network.
Liquid Spectrum advanced software applications
Planning Tool Calibrator
Enables you to proactively ensure optimal system performance by providing access—for the first time—to real-time, accurate planning data for both the existing hardware and new planned services.
Bandwidth Optimizer
Uses customer-defined service policies and suggests the ideal capacity, hardware configuration, and spectral placement for any channel, across any network path.
PinPoint OTDR
Allows you to precisely localize and address potential trouble spots, reducing the risk of outages and accelerating repair times from days to hours.
Channel Margin Gauge
Provides instant real-time visibility into the efficiency of your network and lets you know if you can run your deployed optics at higher capacities.
Photonic Performance Gauge
Provides an instant health check of the photonic network, including optical restoration paths before photonic restoration, with unprecedented real-time visibility of photonic performance (even without active transponders).
Liquid Restoration
Increases service availability with flexible adjustment of deployed coherent optical capacity as needed to route affected services across any available path in the network.
Wondering where to start?
As your partner, Ciena Services ensures that you leverage Liquid Spectrum Analytics Apps to extract the full value of your network assets across any stage of the photonic network lifecycle. We augment your team with our industry-leading experts, tools, and methodologies, including powerful, role-based learning, to implement the incremental changes and improvements required to achieve your business objectives.
