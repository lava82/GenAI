WaveRouter
Ciena’s WaveRouter™ is a purpose-built coherent metro router designed to unify IP and Optical in the metro—with ultimate flexibility, future-proof extensibility, and improved network sustainability.
WaveRouter can easily and flexibly scale Wide Area Network (WAN) traffic—with the ability to scale up and out, delivering capacity when and where it’s needed. With optional WaveLogic™ capabilities, WaveRouter can support dense, any-to-any, high-capacity coherent routing and switching metro applications.
What is metro routing done differently?
WaveRouter represents a true break from legacy constraints—a reimagined routing platform architecture for the converged metro. WaveRouter’s 600mm depth is a footprint-efficient design that fits anywhere. WaveRouter can support a wide range of plugs and submodules without stranding chipset or fabric capacity—whether pluggables (including WaveLogicTM) or ultra-long-haul submodules.
Flexible commons, fabric, and interface modules
WaveRouter offers metro operators a way to easily scale out with extensible switch fabric and flexible cabling options for non-adjacent rows. WaveRouter can reduce blast radius, spread thermal load over multiple racks, and take advantage of fragmented racks.
