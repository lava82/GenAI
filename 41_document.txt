About us
5400
Family
The 5400 Family is optimized for cost-effective, next-generation bandwidth management, enabling efficient aggregation, grooming, and forwarding of multiple traffic types. Both the 5410 and 5430 systems employ Ciena’s intelligent control plane—shared with the 6500 Family—to automate labor-intensive operations including planning, provisioning, and topology and inventory management. The 5400 Family enables the highest availability networks—measured in the field at over six-9s—for mission-critical services.
The highest switching capacity on the market today
You've got massive bandwidth growth fueled by the web-scale effect and cloud migration. We've got the unparalleled switching capacity you need in your core network to handle it.
New enhancements to our 5430 Packet-Optical Platform include 15 Tb/s switching capacity—making it the highest capacity agnostic SONET/SDH/OTN/packet switch on the market. The 5430 combines high and scalable speeds, cost-effectiveness, agility, and optimized packet networking in one platform. We're raising the bar so you can too.
Leading the way in silicon innovation to redefine service economics
We’re experts at designing and building innovative silicon chipsets—and breaking records for capacity, reach, and modulation flexibility. So it’s no surprise the 5430 can now deliver 15 Tb/s switching, a 400G line capacity with WaveLogic 3 Extreme chipset using 16QAM modulation, up to 5x client port density, and over 60% reduction in Watts per switched Gb/s.
No chassis change. No traffic impact. Just lower OPEX, maximized ROI, reduced space, and simplified power planning for a serious competitive edge.
Software-driven service velocity and efficiency
Impressed with what our silicon can do? You haven't met our software yet. The 5430 is packed with intelligent software capabilities that enable fast service turn-up and quicker time to revenue. It integrates with the rest of Ciena's portfolio, including our intelligent control plane and V-WAN, to provide streamlined, automated operations, high network survivability, and on-demand service delivery. Did we mention packet connectivity? It's seamless through MEF-based Ethernet services.
Seamless integration with our portfolio
The 5430 integrates with our Converged Packet Optical products to provide a complete, scalable, and highly efficient optical networking solution. Whether you're looking to integrate with our 6500 Packet-Optical Platform through the WaveLogic 3 Extreme chipset, or our Service-Aware Operating System (SAOS), the 5430 can do it. But we're not stopping there. The 5430 has also been deployed over some foreign line systems in terrestrial and submarine applications.
