6500-D14/S14
6500 Packet-Optical Platform
Architected for high-capacity applications, Ciena’s 6500-D14/S14 configurations converge comprehensive Ethernet, TDM, and WDM capabilities with unconstrained hybrid packet/OTN switching and an intelligent control plane to maximize the bandwidth efficiency and flexibility of the overall network.
Features
Utilizes 1.2 Tb/s of unrestricted hybrid packet/OTN switching for the most efficient use of network resources
Supports the full suite of photonic architectures for service transport over 2.5G to 800G wavelengths
Enables simplified operations and reduced sparing costs through seamless networking flexibility with the 6500 family
Supports both muxponder- and central fabric-based packet/OTN switching solutions, enabling cost-optimized configurations
Offers industry-leading WaveLogic™ coherent technology and intelligent control plane capabilities for scale and service differentiation
Provides a range of differentiated service offerings through various line and equipment protection options
