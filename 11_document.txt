Coherent ELS
Delivering high-capacity coherent DWDM to the edge
Ciena’s Coherent ELS is a coherent-optimized Open Line System (OLS) designed to meet next-generation photonic requirements at the network edge. ELS cost-effectively delivers 100G to 800G coherent DWDM, enabling a full system capacity of up to 28.8 Tb/s, with a minimal footprint and unprecedented operational simplicity.
Coherent ELS features and benefits
Coherent-optimized OLS
Delivers 100G to 800G coherent DWDM to the edge in a compact, hardened form factor across flexible configurations, including 400ZR and 400ZR+ applications.
Fast high-scale deployments
Eases deployments with a stackable plug-and-play design, automatic turn-up, and Low Touch Provisioning (LTP) along with flexible AC or DC powering to address specific site requirements.
ROADM-like operational simplicity
Provides integrated system intelligence and automation for faster service turn-up, troubleshooting, and real-time system optimization with a range of easy-to-manage options.
Unprecedented operational simplicity
A key differentiation of Ciena’s Coherent ELS is the built-in software intelligence and automation that facilitates deployments, accelerates turn-up, and optimizes system performance—enabling a new operational paradigm for photonics at the network edge.
